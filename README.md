## Here given some instruction of how I run the application locally

- At first I created a new empty folder which name is assignment2 and using cmd command I went in vs-code and give npm -init command in terminal.
- Then one by one I installed mongoose, typeScript, Express.js, cors etc.
- Then I setup tsconfig file and all ts file kept in src and all js file kept in dist fulder.
- Firstly, in src I created app.ts and server.ts and then created some folder follwing moduler system and created user.interface.ts, user.model.ts, user.controller.ts, user.services.ts, user.route.ts etc----------.
